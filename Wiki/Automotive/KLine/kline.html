			<h2>Overview:</h2>

			<p>K-line and L-line are protocols used for communication between devices in automotive domain for various
				purposes such as diagnostics and control. K-line protocol is defined in ISO-9141 and it is a single wire
				serial communication protocol. It allows bidirectional communication between a diagnostic tool and
				various ECUs (Electronic Control Units) within the vehicle. ISO-9141 standard specifies electrical
				characteristics, signal encoding, timing and frame structure. L-line protocol is also single wire
				communication protocol used in automotive domain. L-line protocol specifications are defined in ISO
				9141-2 or ISO 14230-2. K-line is used as communication medium through OBD-II where as L-line signal is
				used for bus initialization.</p>

			<h3>The features of K-line bus protocol are as follows</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Single wire to transmit data</li>
				<li>Half duplex communication (one device at a time)</li>
				<li>Multiple devices can connect with single line</li>
				<li>Error detection mechanism (such as checksum)</li>
				<li>Diagnostic capabilities</li>
				<li>Relatively robust and reliable</li>
				<li>Single master architecture</li>
				<li>Cost effective implementation</li>
			</ul>
