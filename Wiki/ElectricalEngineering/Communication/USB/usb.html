				<h3>Transmission</h3>
				<p>USB data is transmitted by toggling the data lines between the J state and the opposite K state. USB
					encodes data using the NRZI line coding:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>0 bit is transmitted by toggling the data lines from J to K or vice versa.</li>
					<li>1 bit is transmitted by leaving the data lines as-is.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>To ensure that there are enough signal transitions for clock recovery to occur in the bitstream, a
					bit stuffing technique
					is applied to the data stream: an extra 0 bit is inserted into the data stream after any occurrence
					of six consecutive 1 bits.
					(Thus ensuring that there is a 0 bit to cause a transmission state transition.) Seven consecutively
					received 1 bits are always an error.
					For USB 3.0, additional data transmission encoding is used to handle the higher signaling rates
					required.</p>

					<figcaption>Example of a Negative Acknowledge packet transmitted by USB 1.1 full-speed device when
						there is no more data to read.
						It consists of the following fields: clock synchronization byte, type of packet, and end of
						packet. Data packets would have
						more information between the type of packet and end of packet.</figcaption>
				</figure>

				<div class="articleSubSubsection">
					<h4>Synchronization Pattern</h4>
					<p>A USB packet begins with an 8-bit synchronization sequence, 00000001â‚‚. That is, after the initial
						idle state J,
						the data lines toggle KJKJKJKK. The final 1 bit (repeated K state) marks the end of the sync
						pattern and
						the beginning of the USB frame. For high-bandwidth USB, the packet begins with a 32-bit
						synchronization sequence.</p>
				</div><!-- Section "Synchronization Pattern" end -->

				<div class="articleSubSubsection">
					<h4>End of Packet (EOP)</h4>
					<p>EOP is indicated by the transmitter driving 2 bit times of SE0 (D+ and D- both below max.) and 1
						bit time of J state.
						After this, the transmitter ceases to drive the D+/D- lines and the aforementioned pull-up
						resistors hold it in
						the J (idle) state. Sometimes skew due to hubs can add as much as one bit time before the SE0 of
						the end of packet.
						This extra bit can also result in a bit stuff violation if the six bits before it in the CRC are
						1s. This bit should be ignored by receiver.</p>

			<h2>Packets</h2>
			<p>During USB communication, data is transmitted as packets. Initially, all packets are sent from the host
				via the root hub, and possibly more hubs, to devices. Some of those packets direct a device to send some
				packets in reply.</p>
			<p>After the sync field, all packets are made of 8-bit bytes, transmitted least-significant bit first. The
				first byte is a packet identifier (PID) byte. The PID is actually 4 bits; the byte consists of the 4-bit
				PID followed by its bitwise complement. This redundancy helps detect errors. (A PID byte contains at
				most four consecutive 1 bits, and thus never needs bit-stuffing, even when combined with the final 1 bit
				in the sync field. However, trailing 1 bits in the PID may require bit-stuffing within the first few
				bits of the payload.)</p>

				<p>Handshake packets consist of only a single PID byte, and are generally sent in response to data
					packets. Error detection is provided by transmitting four bits, which represent the packet type
					twice, in a single PID byte using complemented form. The three basic types are ACK, indicating that
					data was successfully received; NAK, indicating that the data cannot be received and should be
					retried; and STALL, indicating that the device has an error condition and cannot transfer data until
					some corrective action (such as device initialization) occurs.</p>
				<p>USB 2.0 added two additional handshake packets: NYET and ERR. NYET indicates that a split transaction
					is not yet complete, while ERR handshake indicates that a split transaction failed. A second use for
					a NYET packet is to tell the host that the device has accepted a data packet, but cannot accept any
					more due to full buffers. This allows a host to switch to sending small PING tokens to inquire about
					the device's readiness, rather than sending an entire unwanted DATA packet just to elicit a NAK.</p>
				<p>The only handshake packet the USB host may generate is ACK. If it is not ready to receive data, it
					should not instruct a device to send.</p>
			</div><!-- Section "Handshake packets" end -->

			<div class="articleSubsection">
				<h3>Token packets</h3>

				<p>Token packets consist of a PID byte followed by two payload bytes: 11 bits of address and a five-bit
					CRC. Tokens are only sent by the host, never a device. Below are tokens present from USB 1.0:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>IN</b> and <b>OUT</b> tokens contain a seven-bit device number and four-bit function number
						(for multifunction devices) and command the device to transmit DATAx packets, or receive the
						following DATAx packets, respectively.
						<ul>
							<li><b>IN</b> token expects a response from a device. The response may be a NAK or STALL
								response or a DATAx frame. In the latter case, the host issues an ACK handshake if
								appropriate.</li>
							<li><b>OUT</b> token is followed immediately by a <b>DATAx</b> frame. The device responds
								with ACK, NAK, NYET, or STALL, as appropriate.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><b>SETUP </b> operates much like an OUT token, but is used for initial device setup. It is
						followed by an eight-byte DATA0 frame with a standardized format.</li>
					<li><b>SOF (Start of Frame) </b> Every millisecond (12000 full-bandwidth bit times), the USB host
						transmits a special SOF (start of frame) token, containing an 11-bit incrementing frame number
						in place of a device address. This is used to synchronize isochronous and interrupt data
						transfers. High-speed USB 2.0 devices receive seven additional SOF tokens per frame, each
						introducing a 125 Âµs microframe (60000 high-bandwidth bit times each).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>USB 2.0 also added a PING Token and a larger three-byte SPLIT Token:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>PING</b> asks a device if it is ready to receive an OUT/DATA packet pair. PING is usually
						sent by a host when polling a device that most recently responded with NAK or NYET. This avoids
						the need to send a large data packet to a device that the host suspects is unwilling to accept
						it.[11] The device responds with ACK, NAK, or STALL, as appropriate.</li>
					<li><b>SPLIT</b> is used to perform split transactions. Rather than tie up the high-bandwidth USB
						bus sending data to a slower USB device, the nearest high-bandwidth capable hub receives a SPLIT
						token followed by one or two USB packets at high-bandwidth, performs the data transfer at full-
						or low-bandwidth, and provides the response at high-bandwidth when prompted by a second SPLIT
						token. It contains a seven-bit hub number, 12 bits of control flags, and a five-bit CRC.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>A data packet consists of the PID followed by 0â€“1,024 bytes of data payload (up to 1,024 bytes for
					high-speed devices, up to 64 bytes for full-speed devices, and at most eight bytes for low-speed
					devices),[12] and a 16-bit CRC.</p>
				<p>There are two basic forms of data packet, DATA0 and DATA1. A data packet must always be preceded by
					an address token, and is usually followed by a handshake token from the receiver back to the
					transmitter. The two packet types provide the 1-bit sequence number required by stop-and-wait ARQ.
					If a USB host does not receive a response (such as an ACK) for data it has transmitted, it does not
					know if the data was received or not; the data might have been lost in transit or it might have been
					received but the handshake response was lost.</p>
				<p>To solve this problem, the device keeps track of the type of DATAx packet it last accepted. If it
					receives another DATAx packet of the same type, it is acknowledged but ignored as a duplicate. Only
					a DATAx packet of the opposite type is actually received.</p>
				<p>If the data is corrupted while transmitted or received, the CRC check fails. When this happens, the
					receiver does not generate an ACK, which makes the sender resend the packet.</p>
				<p>When a device is reset with a SETUP packet, it expects an 8-byte DATA0 packet next.</p>
				<p>USB 2.0 added DATA2 and MDATA packet types as well. They are used only by high-bandwidth devices
					doing high-bandwidth isochronous transfers that must transfer more than 1024 bytes per 125 Âµs micro
					frame (8,192 kB/s).</p>
			</div><!-- Section "Data packets" end -->

			<div class="articleSubsection">
				<h3>PRE packet (tells hubs to temporarily switch to low speed mode)</h3>

				<p>A hub is able to support low bandwidth devices mixed with other speed device via a special PID value,
					PRE. This is required as a USB hub functions as a very simple repeater, broadcasting the host
					message to all connected devices regardless if the packet was for it or not. This means in a mixed
					speed environment, there is a potential danger that a low speed could misinterpret a high or full
					speed signal from the host.</p>
				<p>To eliminate this danger, if a USB hub detects a mix of high speed or full speed and low speed
					devices, it, by default, disables communication to the low speed device unless it receives a request
					to switch to low speed mode. On reception of a PRE packet however, it temporarily re-enables the
					output port to all low speed devices, to allow the host to send a single low speed packet to low
					speed devices. After the low speed packet is sent, an end of packet (EOP) signal tells the hub to
					disable all outputs to low speed devices again.</p>
				<p>Since all PID bytes include four 0 bits, they leave the bus in the full-bandwidth K state, which is
					the same as the low-bandwidth J state. It is followed by a brief pause, during which hubs enable
					their low-bandwidth outputs, already idling in the J state. Then a low-bandwidth packet follows,
					beginning with a sync sequence and PID byte, and ending with a brief period of SE0. Full-bandwidth
					devices other than hubs can simply ignore the PRE packet and its low-bandwidth contents, until the
					final SE0 indicates that a new packet follows.</p>
