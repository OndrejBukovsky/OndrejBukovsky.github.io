K-line protocol is defined in ISO-9141 and it is a single wire serial communication protocol. It allows bidirectional communication between a diagnostic tool and various ECUs (Electronic Control Units) within the vehicle. ISO-9141 standard specifies electrical characteristics, signal encoding, timing and frame structure. L-line protocol is also single wire communication protocol used in automotive domain. L-line protocol specifications are defined in ISO 9141-2 or ISO 14230-2. K-line is used as communication medium through OBD-II where as L-line signal is used for bus initialization.</p><div align="center"><img src="'+a+'" width="60%"></div><h3 id="the-features-of-k-line-bus-protocol-are-as-follows" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#the-features-of-k-line-bus-protocol-are-as-follows"><span>The features of K-line bus protocol are as follows</span></a></h3><ul><li>Single wire to transmit data</li><li>Half duplex communication (one device at a time)</li><li>Multiple devices can connect with single line</li><li>Error detection mechanism (such as checksum)</li><li>Diagnostic capabilities</li><li>Relatively robust and reliable</li><li>Single master architecture</li><li>Cost effective implementation</li></ul>',6)]))}const d=i(n,[["render",s],["__file","kline.html.vue"]]),u=JSON.parse('{"path":"/Automotive/KLine/kline.html","title":"K-Line","lang":"en-US","frontmatter":{},"headers":[{"level":2,"title":"Overview","slug":"overview","link":"#overview","children":[{"level":3,"title":"The features of K-line bus protocol are as follows","slug":"the-features-of-k-line-bus-protocol-are-as-follows","link":"#the-features-of-k-line-bus-protocol-are-as-follows","children":[]}]}],"git":{},"filePathRelative":"Automotive/KLine/kline.md"}');export{d as comp,u as data};
